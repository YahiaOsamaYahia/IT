<p>An oily skin type is exactly what it sounds like – excess oil on the face produces a persistently shiny or greasy appearance. If you don't treat your oily skin, pores can become clogged and enlarged, and dead skin cells may accumulate. Blackheads, pimples and other types of acne are also common with this skin type.</p>
<a href="Dry%20Skin.html" target="_blank">Dry Skin</a>
<p>Dry skin is an uncomfortable condition marked by scaling, itching, and cracking. It can occur for a variety of reasons. You might have naturally dry skin. But even if your skin tends to be oily, you can develop dry skin from time to time. Dry skin can affect any part of your body.</p>  
<a href="Combination%20Skin.html" target="_blank">Combination Skin</a>
<p>Combination means you are dry in winter and oily in summer. Some people incorrectly use it to mean oily in the T-zone but this is classified as an oily skin type.” Other dermatologists argue that combination skin is a distinct skin type characterized by varying amounts of oil production on the face.</p>
